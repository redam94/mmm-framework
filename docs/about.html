            <h1>About This Framework</h1>
            <p class="lead">
                A vision for rigorous, actionable marketing measurement—built on honest uncertainty quantification, experimental validation, and the belief that better methodology leads to better decisions.

            <h2>The Vision</h2>
            <p>
                The marketing measurement industry is at an inflection point. Clients are asking harder questions: not just "what is the ROI of this channel" but "how confident should we be in that number?" They notice when last year's model says television was the top performer and this year's model says it's digital—with no change in strategy. They're beginning to ask about validation.
            </p>
            <p>
                This framework represents a fundamental rethinking of how marketing measurement should work. It's built on the premise that honest uncertainty is more valuable than false precision, and that validated predictions matter more than impressive-looking outputs.
            </p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h4>💡 The Core Insight</h4>
                <p>
                    The industry is moving toward greater rigor. Organizations that lead this transition—rather than resist it—will build differentiated capabilities and client relationships grounded in demonstrated rather than asserted credibility.
                </p>

            <h2>The Problem We're Solving</h2>
            <p>
                Traditional marketing mix modeling often involves a practice known as <strong>specification shopping</strong>: iteratively adjusting model parameters—lags, decay rates, control variables—until results achieve desired statistical properties or match prior expectations. While this can incorporate genuine domain knowledge, it introduces systematic risks.
            </p>

            <div class="warning-box">
                <h4>⚠️ Why Specification Shopping Is Dangerous</h4>
                <p>
                    When you test multiple specifications and select based on results, you invalidate standard statistical inference. The reported confidence intervals don't reflect actual uncertainty. Worse, the process systematically selects for confirming rather than disconfirming evidence, creating models that look good but may be dangerously miscalibrated.
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                Common post-hoc adjustments—like zeroing out negative media effects—don't just violate statistical principles. They systematically bias results upward and make downstream optimization recommendations unreliable. When everyone uses the same biased methods, an entire industry can be confidently wrong.
            </p>

                    <h4>Validation as Standard Practice</h4>
                    <p>Where feasible, design holdout experiments that test model predictions against reality. This creates a feedback loop distinguishing working models from non-working ones.</p>

                    <h4>Uncertainty as a Feature</h4>
                    <p>Instead of point estimates implying false precision, we quantify and communicate uncertainty. When confident, we say so. When not, we recommend experiments rather than papering over it with specification choices.</p>

                    <p>Different business questions require different tools. Attribution, incrementality, and optimization questions aren't all best answered by the same model. We match methodology to question.</p>

                    <h4>Pre-Specified Analysis</h4>
                    <p>Define modeling decisions before seeing results. This reduces researcher degrees of freedom and ensures that findings reflect data patterns rather than analyst choices.</p>

            <h2>What Better Looks Like</h2>
            
            <div class="success-box">
                <h4>✓ Honest Communication</h4>
                <p>
                    "We estimate TV ROI at 1.4 (1.2–1.6, 80% CI). This estimate is validated against geo experiments and robust to specification choices."
                </p>
                <p style="margin-top: 0.75rem;">
                    "Display ROI estimates are highly uncertain, ranging from 0.5 to 2.5 across specifications. We cannot confidently recommend budget changes without additional data."
                </p>
            </div>

            <p>
                This kind of transparency builds trust. Clients can distinguish confident recommendations from uncertain ones. They can make informed decisions about where to act immediately versus where to invest in additional validation.

            <h2>Technical Foundation</h2>
            <p>
                The framework is built on <strong>PyMC-Marketing</strong> for Bayesian modeling, with a complete technical stack including FastAPI backends, Streamlit frontends, and comprehensive testing infrastructure. It supports sophisticated modeling scenarios including nested models with mediated causal pathways, multivariate outcomes with cross-correlations, and principled variable selection that maintains causal validity.
            </p>
            <p>
                Key technical innovations include proper handling of geo-level random effects (which can't identify national media effects), Bayesian variable selection that distinguishes confounders from precision controls, and extensive diagnostics following the Bayesian workflow framework from Gelman et al. (2020).
            </p>
            <p>
                The framework is open source and designed for both individual use and organizational adoption. Comprehensive documentation, mathematical foundations, and educational content help teams understand not just <em>how</em> to use these methods but <em>why</em> they matter.
